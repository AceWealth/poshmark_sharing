# Welcome to the Amazon Pricing


This script is designed for users with a [seller account on the Amazon marketplace](https://services.amazon.com/content/sell-on-amazon.htm?ld=SCSOAStriplogin).

It is designed to automate offering the lowest price for every item in your inventory. After setup, once the script is executed, it will try to offer the lowest price every 15 minutes. You can edit the timing if you desire.

## Let the Price War Begin

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.5+
* Firefox 46.0.1+
* [Selenium](http://selenium-python.readthedocs.io)==2.53.6+

### Setup

#### Git Clone

First clone the repository in terminal:
* `git clone https://github.com/jmausolf/amazon_pricing`

Change directories to enter the local repository:
* `cd amazon_pricing`

#### User Credentials

You will need to create a `credentials.py` file. It is recommended to simply edit the `example_credentials.py` file and rename it.

* amazon_email = "myemail@gmail.com"
* amazon_password = "mysupersecret"

Edit the text in quotes to your actual username and password. Save the file and rename it credentials.py. Assuming you are in the repo directory, the bash command would be `mv example_credentials.py credentials.py` .

#### Firefox

* *Recommendation:* Under Firefox Settings>Privacy: select "Always use private browsing mode" | This will help avoid Amazon captcha's. Adjusting the timing can also help if you have trouble.

### Run Price War App

In terminal run the following command:

* `python price_war.py`

*Note:* If you have several versions of python, you will need to amend the above line to run your python 3 alias, e.g. `python3 price_war.py`.


### Timing

You can adjust the timing from the command line. The default is 900 seconds (15 minutes). Here are some examples:

* Every 30 minutes:
* `python price_war.py -t 1800`

* Every hour:
* `python price_war.py -t 3600`
